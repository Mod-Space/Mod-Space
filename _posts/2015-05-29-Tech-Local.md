Local, Shop Local, Support Local. We all know the drill, support the local economy
and everyone wins. So what about Tech Local. Find your technical consultants
locally instead of looking to the Bay Area, Sacramento, or overseas?

This only works if the right people or products are available locally. I would
not want for example to shop for local Oranges in Nevada. But when the right
people and products are available locally then it only makes sense to shop
locally for all of your needs.

For the first time a group of talented local technical programmers, developers,
designers, and marketers are available under one roof to Modesto area
businesses. So it is time to Tech Local.
