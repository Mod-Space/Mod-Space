A mini-hack is a short hackathon. We are helping to run one on Saturday May 30 at
ModSpace. Come check out the space and have fun spending ten hours building
something cool with a partner.

Teams are two person and presentations will be done with first prize being
awarded by a vote of the participants (no you can not vote for your own team!)
Space is limited to 10 teams so sign up today! If you don't have a partner then
we will work to find one for you.

To sign up for this event please check the details at

(geektech2000@gmail.com) for more information.
