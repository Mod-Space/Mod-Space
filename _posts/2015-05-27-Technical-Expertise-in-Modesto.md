Many business owners in the central valley believe mistakenly that they need to go
outside the valley to find experienced technical consultants. They often end up
seeking in the Bay Area (where they pay top dollar) or India where there are
huge communication barriers. Few realize that there is strong technical talent
residing in the valley.

Many who work in the bay area commute from the valley for many reasons: quality
of life, lower cost of living, nearness to family, or even dislike of city
living. Some of these commuters have decided that they want to work where they
live and so we have several former Bay Area workers who now live and consult
right here in Modesto.

ModSpace is the place where several of these technical workers have decided to
locate their business. The working environment inside the downtown Modesto
coworking space is very laid back and comfortable for those who are accustomed
to working out of the Bay Area.

So whatever your need for technical expertise is, it is likely that someone at
ModSpace has the skillset that your project needs. Contact us today or look at
our consultants page for more information.
