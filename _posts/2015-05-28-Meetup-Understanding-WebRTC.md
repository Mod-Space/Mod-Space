Did you know that modern web browsers can communicate with other browsers
directly peer to peer?

In fact you can pretty much send and receive any kind of data (video, audio,
json, binary...) directly between browsers.

It can even work when the browsers are on different networks through NAT's and
Firewalls.

This browser to browser communication happens using an emerging technology
called WebRTC.

Join us on Thursday, June 4, 2015 at 6pm at our new much larger meetup location,
ModSpace, to learn about how WebRTC works and get some hands on experience using
it.

Bonus Content - The demo app and the hands on lab will use Reactjs the cool new
JavaScript View library from Facebook.
