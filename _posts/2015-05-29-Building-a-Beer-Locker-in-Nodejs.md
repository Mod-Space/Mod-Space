with an ever growing collection of beer, I am in dire need of a way to store and track my beer. What better way to do this than to create an application.

In this multipart series weâ€™ll be creating a RESTful API using Node, Express, Mongoose to interact with MongoDB, Passport for authentication, OAuth2orize for OAuth support, and explore best practices and tools.

When we are done, we should have an API that allows users to authenticate, perform CRUD operations, authorize other applications via OAuth to access the API, have a solid understanding of best practices and tooling, and most important of all, a place to store our beer!

Head on over to my blog to read this multipart series to unlock the mysterious relationship between beer, APIs, and Node.
