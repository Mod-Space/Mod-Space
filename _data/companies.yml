    Nathan has been actively programming since 1984 and he has worn out 
    several keyboards doing so. He earned his B.S. in computer science from 
    C.S.U. Sacramento in 1994 where he specialized in designing operating 
    systems and compilers. Since then he has worked as a corporate instructor, 
    Oracle database administrator, and for the last 12 years as a website 
    programmer.

    Nathan owns Inventaweb.net which specializes in building custom web 
    solutions for their clients. From custom ecommerce solutions to gamified 
    sites or data management solutions Inventaweb is able to tackle your 
    toughest problems and bring process improvement to most projects. Using the 
    latest technology such as AngularJS to build single page applications and 
    Slim Framework to create custom APIs nothing is out of reach.
